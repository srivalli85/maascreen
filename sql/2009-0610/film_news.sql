The original 1994\n"Krantiveer", also directed by Mehul Kumar, starred Nana Patekar,\nDimple Kapadia, Mamta Kulkarni and Atul Agnihotri. <br>\n<br>For 21-year-old Jahan, it was a childhood dream to become an actress. \n<br>\n<br>"Call it (in) the genes and being part of a filmy family, but ever\nsince I can remember I always wanted to be an actress. I must have been\nthree-years-old when I spoke to dad about becoming an actress," she\nsaid. <br>\n<br>The newcomer says she didn''t feel the need to join any acting classes. \n<br>\n<br>"Frankly, I didn''t see any need for that. I come from a family that\nhas made movies for decades; so why not learn straight from them? My\non-the-job training started at home itself as I used to visit my dad''s\nset on a regular basis.

She\nplays a journalist who raises her voice against terrorism, violence and\ncorruption. <br>\n<br>Isn''t that too heavy a subject for a newcomer like her? \n<br>\n<br>"I feel 99 percent of the actresses debut with romantic films. I\nasked myself if I too wanted to follow a conventional approach and the\nanswer was ''no''," said Jahan. <br>\n<br>"I wanted to do something far more challenging because it makes you\nwork harder. Also, though the risks are bigger, the benefits are much\nhigher. I don''t want to be monotonous and instead demonstrate my\ncalibre by playing a role that other actresses out there would possibly\nget after working in five or six films," she added. <br>\n<br>"Krantiveer - the Revolution" features Samir Aftab opposite Jahan.\nThe film has music by Sachin and Jigar and Mehul Kumar is aiming for a\nSeptember-October release. <br>\n<br>To support Mehul Kumar''s new venture, Amitabh Bachchan, Nana\nPatekar and Dimple Kapadia were present at the film''s launch event\naround two months ago. </font>', '2009-06-08', 1, 0),
